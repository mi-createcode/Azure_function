# (Azure_function) Solar Power Generation Prediction - Real-time Data Pipeline

This project demonstrates a practical real-time data pipeline using Azure Functions, Event Hubs, and Teams Webhook integration.  
It collects solar power generation prediction data from an external API, transforms the data, and ingests it into Azure Event Hub for further real-time analysis.

## Features

- Collects real-time solar generation prediction data via external API
- Preprocesses and formats data using Azure Functions (serverless)
- Sends structured data to Azure Event Hubs
- Sends notification to Microsoft Teams via Webhook upon function execution

## Technologies

- Azure Functions (Python)
- Azure Event Hubs
- Microsoft Teams Webhook
- Visual Studio Code
- Azurite (Local Storage Emulator)
